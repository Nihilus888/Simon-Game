README

Simon Game is a memory game that requires the user to input the same sequence
and the same colour as what the computer randomly generates. The player has 5 lives and a total of 30 levels
if the user follows the same sequence and colour, the next level will automatically increment an extra
colour that they need to follow. If the user fails, a life will be decremented and they will repeat the same
level again. Once the player has ran out of lives, the game will be over and it will start from level 1 again.
