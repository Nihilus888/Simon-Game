								### SIMON GAME
------------------

Simon Game is a memory game that requires the user to input the same sequence
and the same colour as what the computer randomly generates. The player has 5 lives and a total of 30 levels
if the user follows the same sequence and colour, the next level will automatically increment an extra
colour that they need to follow. If the user fails, a life will be decremented and they will repeat the same
level again. Once the player has ran out of lives, the game will be over and it will start from level 1 again. 

### PURPOSE AND HISTORY
--------------------

Simon is an electronic game of short-term memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, working for a toy design firm Marvin Glass and Associates, with software programming by Lenny Cope. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over. The original version was manufactured and distributed by Milton Bradley and later by Hasbro after it took over Milton Bradley. Much of the assembly language code was written by Charles Kapps, who taught computer science at Temple University and also wrote one of the first books on the theory of computer programming. Simon was launched in 1978 at Studio 54 in New York City and was an immediate success, becoming a pop culture symbol of the 1970s and 1980s.
